# Automatic Prompt Engineering for Educational Content Generation

This repository contains the research framework and analytical findings for the study titled “Automatic Prompt Engineering for Educational Content Generation.”
Developed by Assna V.S. (MCA Student) and Arjun K.P. (Assistant Professor) from the Department of Computer Applications, LEAD College, Palakkad, the project explores how Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) can optimize the design of prompts used in AI-generated educational content.

The framework integrates:

Template-Based Structuring (Action–Purpose–Expectation model) for aligning AI outputs with learning goals

Multi-Agent Collaboration, simulating educator, designer, and assessment roles

Iterative Refinement using hybrid scoring metrics (BLEU, educator feedback, Bloom’s taxonomy alignment)

Using comparative experiments between manually crafted and automatically optimized prompts, APE achieved:

+28% improvement in alignment with learning objectives

–45% reduction in development time

+21% gain in overall content quality

The results affirm APE’s potential to enhance the scalability, consistency, and quality of AI-assisted instructional design.
The project underscores the ethical importance of maintaining human oversight while leveraging AI automation for education.
